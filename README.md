 - She also makes sure to switch the status of the issue from open to resolved:

</p>
<p>
  
- Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed.

This example illustrated a basic scenario in which a user creates a ticket, the ticket is assigned to an agent, and communication takes place until the issue is resolved.

However, additional situations may arise during the ticketâ€™s assessment. A ticket might be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severity, or routed to a more qualified agent or team based on the complexity of the issue and its impact on the business.

We hope this tutorial provided you with a clearer understanding of the typical life cycle of a ticket. Depending on the size of the company, help desk agents may handle anywhere from 10 to 100 tickets per day.
